<p class="header">Welcome to Renal PatientView</p>

<p>53 renal units in the NHS now provide access to results and clinical letters through this secure online system. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2012/may/04/open-source-software-renal-test-results">PatientView is now used by 19,000 patients</a>, all who have opted-in to access their results online. As a patient you can view your blood results, medicines and letters; record your own blood pressure, glucose values and weight; and make notes to take with you to your next clinic appointment.</p>

<p>Contact your unit if it is <a href="http://www.renal.org/rixg/units.html">listed by The Renal Association</a>, who will provide you with a log in. The information in PatientView comes directly from your renal unit's database, so if you suspect a mistake you should check with your own unit. Contacts for your unit are provided after you log in.</p>

<p>All of this information belongs to you and you are free to share this information with anyone you want, and view it from anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>You can view our <html:link action="/infoLinks">information links</html:link> without logging in.</p>

<p>You can view a <html:link action="/demo">demo</html:link> as if you were a patient.</p>

<p><i>RPV is funded by contributions from renal units in England and Wales and by the Scottish Government in Scotland. Development funding has come from the Department of Health in England, Scotland and Wales, and from NHS Kidney Care.</i></p>
